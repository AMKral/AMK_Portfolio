## Projects
**DL models for determining blood cell malaria-infection**<br>
This was my capstone project for the Applied Data Science course.<br>
A library of 27000 images of stained single red blood cells that may be infected with the malaris-causing falciparum parasite. The aim of the project was to develop a deep learning model that would accurately identify if a blood cell were infected or not. <br>

**SOMETHING ELSE DEALING WITH ML**

**SVHN deep learning models to identify images of numbers**<br>
A simpler project than the malaria infection status project<br>

## About me:
**History**<br>
I am a recent convert to data science, but I am not unfamiliar with science or large datasets.<br>
I have been a bench scientist doing drug discovery since Methuselah. My deepest expertise is in biochemistry and enzymology. However, I have lots of experience in cell biology and oncology murine models. Why am I telling you about this here? Well, my domain expertise is pretty solid. This is what I bring to my projects: a real understanding of WHY the study is important and WHAT features are important and HOW. I have been on the domain expert side of data science, and I understand my worth as such; as a domain expert data scientist, I am a bridge to explain data science to bench scientists and vice-versa. I save time and effort without any coding.<br>
I try to explain my domain-specific thoughts and judgements throughout my projects so that you will hopefully see some of what I bring to the table.<br>
Enjoy!<br>
